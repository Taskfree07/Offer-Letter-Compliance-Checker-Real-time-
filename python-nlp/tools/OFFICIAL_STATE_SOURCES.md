## ⚠️ IMPORTANT NOTES

### What Makes a Source "Official":
✅ Ends in `.gov`
✅ State labor department
✅ State legislature/statutes site
✅ Official employment law guides

### What to AVOID:
❌ `.com` websites (even if they look official)
❌ Law firm blogs (secondary sources)
❌ Wikipedia
❌ LLM responses without verification

### When Laws Are Unclear:
1. Check multiple .gov pages
2. Look for official FAQ/guides
3. Cross-reference with SHRM (but verify)
4. Note in JSON if uncertain
5. Mark for legal review

---

## 📊 VERIFICATION CHECKLIST

For each state JSON file:
- [ ] All laws have .gov source URLs
- [ ] Statute citations are exact (not paraphrased)
- [ ] Effective dates are confirmed
- [ ] No LLM-generated content without verification
- [ ] Cross-checked against 2+ sources when possible
- [ ] Severity levels make sense (error for violations, warning for best practices)

## 🎯 ACCURACY TARGET

**Our Goal: 95%+ accuracy**

How to achieve this:
1. Use ONLY official .gov sources
2. Copy exact statute text
3. Verify every citation
4. Note effective dates
5. Mark anything uncertain for legal review

**Remember:** It's better to have 10 states with 95% accuracy than 20 states with 70% accuracy!
