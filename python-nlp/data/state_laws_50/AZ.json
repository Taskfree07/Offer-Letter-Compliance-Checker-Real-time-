Replace with: 'Employee agrees not to engage in activities that directly compete with the Company's business in Arizona for a period of [insert reasonable time frame, e.g., 6-12 months], and only to the extent such activities are substantially similar to those performed for the Company.' Alternatively, consider using a narrower confidentiality and trade secret protection clause to protect the Company's interests.",
